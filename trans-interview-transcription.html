        How did transitioning affect your ability to get work? Is there anything that they did well? Is
        there anything they could have done better?
        <p>
          "I didn't have a job while I was transitioning because I specifically chose to fully transition while I
          was in the process of moving 120 miles away from my home town so that I could get a clean
          break and people wouldn't know me as 'that guy who wants to be a girl' which tends to be how
          I am still remembered in my home town. Once I moved getting a job was difficult because
          people don't necessarily want to hire a trans person because we are seen as trouble waiting to
          happen. I also had a flare up of my mental health problems. My mental health problems aren't
          because of being trans but being trans does make them more difficult."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is also in issue that all of my certificates are in my dead name and this immediately outs
          you in an interview. I found that job offers suddenly disappear once they saw my certificates.
          My current work have been really understanding and supported me by giving time off for
          operations and they didn't make any announcements about why that was, they just said to
          people that it was for medical reasons and I didn't have to out myself to everyone which was
          really good."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What have been your notable moments of gender euphoria? Have you had any experiences that
        were way better than you initially thought they would be?
        <p>
          "As an initial explanation of gender euphoria; it a s term that trans people tend to use because
          something we are often diagnosed with is something called Gender Dysphoria, which is a feeling
          of not feeling right about how you are versus your gender. Gender Euphoria is the opposite of
          that, those moments where you start to transition and you're feeling really comfortable in your
          true gender and there's these moments of happiness as opposed to the moments of feeling
          awful; so it is trying to put a positive spin on it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think for me my first really noticeable moment of gender euphoria was when I got my first
          anti-testosterone medication - it is the same meds that cisgender men get for prostate issues
          and one of the side effects for them, is that they feel awful from the lack of testosterone. For
          me that was just a mazing it was like a huge weight being lifted finally."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There were smaller things like feeling like I was opening up more as a person and talking more,
          expressing my emotions more and I think that a lot of that comes down to not feeling like I had
          to meet the stereotype of a cisgender man anymore - I could just be me."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How visible do you feel you are? Have you found that you try to limit your visibility based on
        how safe you feel?
        <p>
          "Yeah, I definitely feel like I have had to limit my visibility sometimes, I feel kind of half and half,
          I am more visible with people that I am comfortable with and that I trust; I tend to let people
          know if I feel safe with them. With most people I do try and stay 'Stealth' if possible and it really
          depends on the situation - if I am in a space with people I trust and I know that it is safe or an
          LGBT space, I feel a lot more comfortable to bring it up. If I am somewhere out of the way and I
          don't feel safe I will try and keep it to myself."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For me, I wouldn't be open on my first day in a new office at a new company, I'd need to get to
          know people because as much as company might at the surface level claim "we stand up for
          trans rights and we are comfortable with trans people here" you really need to get to know the
          personal situation with what is going on with people in the company as the last thing you want
          to do is immediately come out and then you find that there's actually, despite what the
          overarching company is saying, that there are a lot of people at ground level who are not
          onboard with that at all."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        How do you handle personal questions? Have you found that people have become more
        personal in their question asking as trans people become more visible? What does non-binary
        mean?
        <p>
          "I think for me there has always been a lot of questions around being trans for me I air on the
          side of preferring to educate as opposed to just saying go away, I will answer a questions and
          then tell them 'I will answer this but it is a very personal question, and there are lot of trans
          people who don't want to answer these questions' and I think a lot of it depends on the person
          asking."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Some people are trying to clearly further their own agenda they have this idea that trans
          people are bad people and they will ask a 'gotcha' question which supports their own view and
          agenda. Those people I tend to ignore as you're not going to appease them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "If it is someone who has asked a question because they don't really understand what is and
          isn't appropriate, I will try and explain to them as best I can and then tell them that in future
          maybe most trans people might not really want to answer that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would also say that a lot of these questions tend to come down to common misconceptions -
          a very common one is that trans people are just 'Super-Gay', like you have a gay man who
          becomes a trans woman and it can be a bit tiring answering the same question over and over
          again. Gender and sexuality are very separate things - a trans person can be straight, gay,
          bisexual that has nothing to do with who they are as a person, that is who they are attracted to
          which is a different matter."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am binary, so I am not the expert in this area! Binary people stick to the gender binary which
          is common in the western world - you are male or female, there is nothing in-between. Non
          binary people don't necessarily stick to that binary, whether they are somewhere in-between, or
          they move back and forth - they just don't conform to that binary. It's quite unusual to people
          who come from a western perspective, however it is not unusual in a lot of Polynesian cultures,
          they may recognize up to 5 different genders."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Have there been any expectations put onto you? Do you feel any pressures (e.g. like you have to
        be "perfect" as you may be the only trans person that someone may meet?)
        <p>
          "Yes definitely. I tend to get pressure from both sides. So more traditional people that say that
          in order for me to be a proper woman I have to meet every stereotype they have of a woman
          and be super-feminine, wear dresses and be Disney princess essentially. On the other side of
          the coin, you have people who say that if I have any feminine traits then I am just confused and I
          don't realize that a man can wear a dress if he wants. You have these two pressures on either
          side and there is also a lot of pressure from being the only trans person that a lot of people
          might meet. So whatever I do, is to them, what EVERY trans person does - so whatever I do, is
          what all trans people do. That is extra difficult when having mental health problems as they
          don't realise there is an intersectionality there."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think you will find this with any minority group really, people will tend to think 'oh - that
          person is part of that group, and this is what they do therefore all of them do that'."

        Have you found that your relationship has changed? Do you feel more protective of your
        daughter than you did previously?
        <p>
          "Had to think about this! To me, my relationship with Lucy has not changed at all. I think that
          this is because in my head, I think about Lucy as being female and so when I talk about her as a
          baby or as a small child, I talk about her as being a small female child or a little girl. In my head,
          that is what she has always been because that is how I see her."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do find that people who have been friends with me for a long time or our family, they find it
          quite hard to understand how I have changed my view of that, somehow changing history to fit
          with the picture - but to me, I guess Lucy has always been this little girl, this woman; and it fits
          with the narrative in my head."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Did you experience any societal pressures from having a trans child? Did you find people putting
        expectations onto you?
        <p>
          "Quite luckily I suppose I didn't find that there were a lot of negative reactions to it, but I would
          say that everybody's journey is different, it was a particularly long journey for Lucy and I as it
          was 10 years - I did find that people expected me to know a lot about trans rights and trans
          feelings and a lot of the terminology and things; that I would just understand what each of these
          things mean and that I would be able to explain these to them - which was odd as I was
          learning all the time myself, it was a steep learning curve for me."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Have you had any overly personal questions? Have people started to ask personal things as
        trans people and issues have become more visible?
        <p>
          "Yeah, I've had people once they have come to know that Lucy has transitioned, ask me
          questions about her clothing, her genitals, really personal questions and you think to yourself
          "Would you ask this about someone else's child? Would you approach anyone else about their
          child and ask these really personal questions - it just isn't something that you would do in
          normal conversation or even if you were trying to get to know someone so it seems odd that
          people think that it is quite normal to ask you personal questions."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Have you noticed yourself looking at workplaces / public places and thinking how you could
        improve trans inclusion?
        <p>
          "I Do! I suppose one thing I do tend to do is look at bathrooms a lot because I know that that
          can be difficult both for trans people and nonbinary people - look to see how permanently
          gendered they are and do they need to be. I ask myself how comfortable I would feel?
          "It has made me aware of things like if clubs are called Woman's Club or Man's club, or the way
          things are phrased, how would you feel if you were trans and where would you put yourself?
          How inclusive is it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "To me, more and more, when you are going to work you go there to do a job that you are
          educated to do and that you are experienced in doing and when you get to the door you should
          almost leave gender at the door. It should not matter. What should matter is how you do your
          job, how good you are and what you get done. It should not matter if you are female, male,
          nonbinary, trans - that should all be something that is left out of the conversation."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What is the one thing that you wish people could be aware of? Or have told you?
        <p>
          "To be open minded I guess and to be willing to learn. There are several things for me which
          have been a steep learning curve and be open to understanding new things and how things look
          differently. One of my other children, when I was trying to get my head round transgender and
          where that fits with gender and sexuality, saying to me that it is a "rainbow for a reason" and
          that there are lots of colours and shades of gender and sexuality and I had to get my head
          around that concept, as it isn't the way I grew up to understand things."
        </p>
        <p>
          "When you say top people that there is a difference between gender and sexuality - on the
          surface it seems quite simple. It took me a while to understand this and how it works. So for
          example, just because I have a transgender daughter it didn't mean that she couldn't be
          attracted to another woman and in fact, Lucy was married for 5 years to another transgender
          woman. The whole issue of the gender that Lucy is and the sexuality that she feels are
          completely separate. So I would just say be open minded. I loved the phrase 'It's a rainbow for a
          reason.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          "We tend to imagine that other people feel the same fears we do sometimes. When Lucy was
          first beginning to transition, I got myself all keyed up and ready to speak to her younger siblings
          about it and how they would understand it. I sat Lucy's younger sister down for a chat and the
          only thing she said was 'I've always wanted a Sister!' - that was it. She didn't want to know any
          more than that!"
