        31st March 2021 is <span class="text--bold">Trans Day of Visibility</span> and to help us understand some of the not so obvious issues and prejudices faced by trans people both at work and in a wider context, HS2's Onboard Network interviewed <span class="text--bold">Lucy Gilbert</span>, Software Engineer from <span class="text--bold">Trail App</span> and her mum, <span class="text--bold">Melodie Gilbert</span>, Occupational Hygienist from <span class="text--bold">Park Health and Safety Partnership</span> who are working with Phase 1's <span class="text--bold">Fusion</span> in delivering HS2.
      </p>
      <p>
        HS2's <span class="text--bold">Dan Smith</span> had an open conversation with Lucy and Mel asking them questions that show how being a trans woman and having a trans daughter can provide some pretty big life hurdles; hurdles that <span class="text--bold text--italic">cisgender</span> people <span class="text--bold text--italic">(people whose sex matches their gender)</span> may never have considered.

          Watch this short video where Lucy and Mel give their view on some of the issues around transitioning and how workplaces can be more trans inclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being an ally to trans people not only helps overcome some of these hurdles but also promotes diversity within teams and businesses. Cherishing diversity in teams harnesses the wider benefits of diverse thinking, bringing with it a breadth of experience and talent.
