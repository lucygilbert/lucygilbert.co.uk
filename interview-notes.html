    <h2>Trans Day of Visibility interview notes</h2>

    <h3>1. How did your work behave/react to you transitioning? Is there anything that they did well? Is there anything they could have done better?</h3>

    <p>I didn't have a job while transitioning - I specifically chose to fully transition as I was moving 120 miles away to get a clean break so people didn't know me as "that guy that wants to be a girl". Getting a job once I was there was difficult, both because people don't want to hire a trans person if there's other options, we're seen as "trouble waiting to happen", and because I had a flare up of mental health problems - my mental health problems aren't because of being trans but being trans makes them more difficult. There's also a problem with certification because it all tends to be in your dead name, which immediately outs you to the interviewer and you find that job offers suddenly disappear after they see your certificates.</p>

    <p>My current work have been very understanding when it comes to things like time off for the operation, and they didn't make any kind of announcement when I needed that  time off, so people that didn't need to know about me being trans weren't informed, they were just told there was a medical issue and I was having time off. To this day there are people in my company who don't know I'm trans because it has always been left up to me when I feel comfortable telling someone, it's never shared without my consent.</p>

    <p>They also hire people based not only on interviews and technical tests but also based on meeting the team and being a cultural fit. So if someone did express transphobic sentiments then I would have an opportunity to say that I wouldn't be comfortable working with that person, though thankfully that hasn't happened as of yet.</p>

    <p>There's also different ways of making an inclusive workplace. In my current place it is treated as a non-issue, but in previous places I've worked in, mostly when I worked as a barmaid, it wasn't an issue but it was a bonding thing, so I was the trans girl and people would make light hearted jokes about it, there was a gay guy and there was similar jokes for him, and the Polish girl and various other differences for every team member and it was all celebrated in a way via the medium of taking the mick. Never in  a mean or aggressive way but as a way of bonding that brought us all together. Though the appropriate approach is definitely based on the workplace and the culture.</p>

    <h3>2. What have been your notable moments of gender euphoria? Have you had any experiences that were way better than you initially thought they would be?</h3>

    <p>My most notable moment was when I first got anti-testosterone medication - it's the same medication that cis men get for prostate issues, and they find the lack of testosterone awful, for me is was one of the most wonderful feelings in my life. Like a weight had been lifted.</p>

    <p>There's also sexism, which can be a complex issue for trans people. Over the course of my life I've interacted with a lot of people with very old school beliefs, and while it is deeply annoying to be treated in a sexist manner - especially as I have experienced male privilege, and the difference in treatment is so clear, to know that your opinion and your agency as a man is respected so much more than as a woman is very frustrating - but it is, in a way, validating. Like, “you're a sexist ass, but the fact that you know I'm trans and yet see me so completely as a woman that you apply all your subconscious female bias to me is kinda sweet in a weird yet very annoying way.”</p>

    <p>There was a lot of things I didn't realise would change that were a pleasant surprise, like opening up more as a person, talking more, expressing my emotions more, and I think it all came down to feeling less like I had to supress everything to convince everyone I met all the stereotypes of a cis man.</p>

    <h3>3. How visible do you feel you are? Have you found that you try to limit your visibility based on how safe you feel?</h3>

    <p>I'm sort of half and half. I'm visible with the people that I'm comfortable with and I trust - I'm stealth with everyone else. I definitely decide on whether to talk about being trans based on the situation - in a LGBT space, or in a place with people I trust, I'll bring it up if it's relevant, if I'm in some dive bar in the sticks, I'm not telling anyone because that can and has lead to a swift smack in the mouth.</p>

    <p>I also think that I perhaps overestimate my visibility. When I see and hear myself recorded, I see my trans-ness quite obviously but I do tend to pass reasonably well to most strangers so I think there may be an element of me being over-critical of myself and picking apart my passing.</p>

    <h3>4. How do you handle personal questions? Have you found that people have become more personal in their question asking as trans people become more visible?</h3>

    <p>I don't think the level of personal questioning has changed over the years. Once people know you're trans they have personal questions, they always have for as long as I've been out. I handle them depending on the person - some people are clearly asking because they are furthering their agenda - they're trying to provide 'gotcha questions', I've tried engaging with those people and it never helps, they have decided that trans people are bad and they will only accept answers that match that assumption. Some people are genuinely just curiously but don't really understand what's appropriate to ask - with them I will try and educate as much as possible and I'll answer most questions even if they're a bit personal, while pointing out that most trans people won't want to answer them.</p>

    <p>I think another aspect of this is not just personal questions but also common misconceptions. It may not seem a big deal to have to clear those up, but when you have to do it again and again with a lot people you are out to, it can become pretty tiring. A lot of them seem to focus on the intersection of gender and sexuality - that trans people are just “super gay” people, we are not. Gender and sexuality are separate concerns and people can have any mix of gender identity and sexuality. This also causes some confusion because some cis people seem to assume that trans people are all straight. “Why would you transition if you're gay or bi?” etc. My being a woman has everything to do with who I am and nothing to do with who I'm attracted to. Also, by that logic, if trans people should remain their birth sex if it would make them straight, then that would mean that gay people should transition to become straight - which is obviously ridiculous. Trans people can transition and be gay, because there's nothing wrong with being gay and it's not something to be avoided.</p>

    <h3>5. Have there been any expectations put onto you? Do you feel any pressures (e.g. like you have to be ”perfect” as you may be the only trans person that someone may meet?)</h3>

    <p>Definitely. There's more traditional people that expect that I should match every stereotype of a woman to be a "proper woman", and on the other end of the scale, people who think that if I have any feminine trait then I'm just some confused man who doesn't realise that a man can where a dress if he wants. Both of these types of people should just be ignored, you'll never appease them.</p>

    <p>There is a lot of pressure when people know I'm trans because I'm usually the only trans person they know so whatever I do is "what trans people do", which is extra difficult when combined with having mental health problems. I think that is a problem faced by any minority group.</p>

    <h3>Tips</h3>

    <h3>1. Do you have any advice for people who are considering their own relationship with their gender?</h3>

    <p>Be prepared to put in a lot of the effort yourself - the NHS isn't great for trans healthcare. There's long wait times for every trans service. To quote the NHS: “The maximum waiting time for non-urgent, consultant-led treatments is 18 weeks from [...] when the hospital or service receives your referral letter.” Personally I waited 52 weeks, and it's not unheard of to wait up to 2 years. This is clearly unacceptable but it is the reality we currently live in, so if you find yourself debating your gender identity, I suggest going to the doctor and getting the ball rolling on referrals. Then start exploring the issue yourself, if you change your mind you can always cancel the referral (and please do as it frees up appointments for those who need them.)</p>

    <p>Also a lot of the answers do have to come from within even when you are seeing the doctors and psychiatrists - they can't tell you if you're trans or not, they can only help you to answer the question. Answering that question tends to be a very personal journey so I can't give you the exact steps for you, but I'd say that a good starting point is answering how exactly you feel about your gender and what makes you feel that way. Do you see any reasons for the feelings or do they seem innate? Take small steps, go out presenting as the gender you feel aligns with your identity, maybe just for a walk to begin with, or a meal with close friends. See how that makes you feel.</p>

    <h3>2. Any advice or tips for cis people to be a trans ally?</h3>

    <p>Beginner: Don't ask my "real name", it's Lucy, my dead name is nothing you ever need to use, so you never need to know.</p>

    <p>Intermediate: You wouldn't ask a cis person about their genitals, being trans doesn't make my genitals a matter of public record.</p>

    <p>Advanced: Don't tell me what I'm offended by, I like that you're trying but I know what is offensive to me - that one applies to pretty much any minority group.</p>

    <p>Generally, please vote and let your representatives in government know that you think trans rights are worth protecting. There is a vocal minority at the moment trying to control the discourse and claim that their view is the majority, that giving trans people rights and protection from discrimination somehow lessens the rights of others. These  people are already having a chilling effect on the progress of trans rights in this country.</p>

    <h3>3. Any advice for workplaces and colleagues to be trans inclusive?</h3>

    <p>Stand up for trans people when you see transphobia. It is a very “othering” experience and to feel like no one else cares when it happens just isolates trans people further, pushing them out of social and professional interaction, limiting their career mobility and even jeopardising their continued employment. You may think that silence is not getting involved but remaining silent in the face of bigotry is in itself making a statement - a statement that you feel it is acceptable and allowed in the workplace.</p>

    <p>Don't overly gender things, it makes it difficult for non-binary people and binary trans people who are early in their transition. Private toilet cubicles, as a perfect example, do not need to be gendered - in fact this isn't ideal for cis people either, because if a lot of other people of your gender are using the bathroom then you have to wait even if there are perfectly usable private cubicles available marked for the other gender.</p>

    <p>When trying to make things better for trans people, remember that that doesn't just mean trans women - trans men and non-binary people exist too. When you feel the need to create men's and women's groups, ask yourself: is this necessary? What will non-binary people do in this situation? Another common oversight is assuming that no trans person has periods, trans men may well have them and if you are doing things to help accommodate women during their period, try and do it in such a way as to help trans men too.</p>
