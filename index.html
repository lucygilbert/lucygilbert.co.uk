        <h2>Trailsuite</h2>

        <h3>Software engineer</h3>

        <p>Operations management software.</p>

        <p>Full stack engineer. Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL.</p>

        <p>I have helped Trailsuite move away from their original monolithic architecture towards micro-services,  the implementation of CQRS and event-sourcing, and the transition from Angular to React and Redux. We also handled the growth of the company from only a handful of stores using the app to hundreds, scaling the technology to respond to this.<br />
        I dealt with the integration of a variety of APIs and platforms, including social media (incl. Facebook, Twitter, TripAdvisor), hospitality systems (incl. Forth, HospitalityGem, LiveStore), and emailing solutions (Mandrill and MailChimp).</p>

        <p>Online catering marketplace and related mobile app.</p>

        <p>Full stack junior developer. PHP/Symfony2, AngularJS, Ionic, MongoDB.</p>

        <p>I worked across the stack, and was involved in DevOps for the company. I produced a <a href="http://www.github.com/lucygilbert/citypantry-mobile-vendor-app">mobile web app</a> and Android app for the company's vendors. I assisted in integrating a variety of third party tools and APIs into the site. We adhered to an Agile/Scrum methodology, with 2 week sprints planned in JIRA and continuous integration with Jenkins. There was a strong focus on test-driven and data-driven development, with comprehensive functional and unit testing in PHPUnit and Jasmine, and with A/B testing using a custom Symfony2 bundle.</p>
