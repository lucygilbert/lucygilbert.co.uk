        <p>Testing in Trail is covered by RSpec feature testing and Jasmine, Jest and Enzyme unit and integration testing.</p>

        <h2>Backend</h2>

        <p><span class="text--large text--bold">Ruby</span> including the Rails framework, RSpec, Sidekiq etc.</p>
        <p>The <span class="text--bold">Trail backend</span> is a Rails app, architected around a domain-driven design, using event-sourcing and CQRS, with PostgreSQL and RSpec testing</p>
        <p>It integrates with various hospitality and retail systems, from Forth to HospitalityGem. The platform extends out onto AWS, making use of DynamoDB, Lambda and S3. It integrates with Stripe and Chargebee for billing, and Segment and Mixpanel for metrics recording.</p>

        <p>Operations management software.</p>

        <p>Full stack engineer. Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL.</p>

        <p>I have helped Trailsuite move away from their original monolithic architecture towards micro-services,  the implementation of CQRS and event-sourcing, and the transition from Angular to React and Redux.</p>
        <p>We also handled the growth of the company from only a handful of stores using the app to thousands, scaling the technology to respond to this.</p>
        <p>I dealt with the integration of a variety of APIs and platforms, including social media (incl. Facebook, Twitter, TripAdvisor), hospitality systems (incl. Forth, HospitalityGem, LiveStore), emailing solutions (Mandrill and MailChimp), and custom integration with Zapier.</p>

        <p>I also assisted in integrating a variety of third party tools and APIs into the site, such as Twilio and Segment.</p>
        <p>We adhered to an Agile/Scrum methodology, with 2 week sprints planned in JIRA and continuous integration with Jenkins.
